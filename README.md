# Stock-Strike
Hack-and-wellness Hackathon project made with Flask, Beautiful Soup, and SMTP Python modules.

## Functionality
The website takes in the ticker symbol of the stock you want to track, the price target you have for the stock, and your email. If the price of the stock reaches the price target, you will receive an email confirming that your price target has been met.
